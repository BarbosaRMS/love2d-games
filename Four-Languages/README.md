# Four-Languages

## What is this?
This is a small game that will list four words in different languages on the left, and four languages on the right.

You need to match each word with its language to gain points.

This is just a small idea I had, since I was wondering how viable it would be to memorize vocabulary for different languages at once.

## Note
I don't speak Spanish, Japanese, Esperanto, or French fluently.

I used Google Translate for a lot of the Spanish/French words (I'm more familiar with basics of Japanese and Esperanto).

You might want to double-check the words before you use this for learning? :)

## Languages
* Esperanto
* Spanish
* Japanese (romanji)
* French

If you'd like to learn Esperanto, [Lernu.net](http://en.lernu.net/index.php) is a great one-stop resource!
